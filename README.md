# Sort Visualizer

This is a progressive web app built using React and is used to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc.

## Run
Install the necessary dependencies by using 'npm install' command or 'npm i'
then you can run this app by using 'npm start command'

## Purpose

I wanted to learn React and also learn classic sorting algorithms. 


## App Design

The design of the app was largely inspired by Google's [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/design/).

The app is responsive, meaning it works across a variety of screen sizes and dimensions.

The app has a switch for turning on dark mode.
